_Designing the future of internet-based experiences_

## About

Welcome to the Scattered-Systems, we are a privately owned software company designing the furure of internet-based experiences. With our ecosystem we hope to enable the common user to comfortably operate in any digital space, decentralized or elsewise, while supporting a unique blend of customizable utilities, interfaces, and interactions. Current frustrations with the current state of software development inspired many of the developer centric features we plan on including, such as our smart-contract marketplace

In order to access the ecosystem users will be required to download Proton, our cross-platform gateway application. Upon download, users will be greeted with an extensive onboarding process covering everything from the initial configuration of their ENS name (and purchase if neccessary) to the granular customizations availible for the user to explore. Each of these customziations is stored in the users Flow, a wrapper around their primary ENS name, which enables them to operate three sperate aliases which pull resources from a single master.
