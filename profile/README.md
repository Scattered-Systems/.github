## _Building the next generation of internet-based experiences_

Welcome, we are a privately funded decentralized initiative currently engaging in the development of our unified interface, Proton, which seamlessly integrates a handful of novel technical solutions to enable the everyday user to migrate onto Web3 platforms. Additionally, we are currently seeking an initial round of investors to support our ongoing efforts.
