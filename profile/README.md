_Designing the future of internet-based experiences_

## About

Welcome to the Scattered-Systems, we are a privately owned software company designing the furure of internet-based experiences. With our ecosystem we hope to enable the common user to comfortably operate in any digital space, decentralized or elsewise, while supporting a unique blend of customizable utilities, interfaces, and interactions. 

In order to access the ecosystem users will be required to download Proton, our cross-platform gateway application. Upon download, users will be greeted with an extensive onboarding process covering everything from the initial configuration of their ENS name (and purchase if neccessary) to the granular customizations availible for the user to explorer. Supporting the growth of the ecosystem is our NFT marketplace, which supports a number of unique operations particularly for developers as they will be encouraged to release their smart-contracts as platform extensions further allowing them to generate passive income.
