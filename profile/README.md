_Designing the future of internet-based experiences_

## About

Welcome to the Scattered-Systems, we are a privately owned software company designing the furure of internet-based experiences. With our ecosystem we hope to enable the common user to comfortably operate in any digital space, decentralized or elsewise, while supporting a unique blend of customizable utilities, interfaces, and interactions. Features such as our smart-contract marketplace are designed to fuel the overall growth of our ecosystem; ecouraging developers with chances at earning passive income streams, reducing the overall complexity of blockchain architecture for end-users, and enabling a new wave of standards to be enforced within contract design.

In order to access the ecosystem users will be required to download Proton, our cross-platform gateway application. Upon download, users will be greeted with an extensive onboarding process covering everything from the initial configuration of their ENS name (and purchase if neccessary) to the granular customizations availible for the user to explore. Each of these customziations is stored in the users Flow, a wrapper around their primary ENS name, which enables them to operate three sperate aliases which pull resources from a single master.
